        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Core Idea:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of structuring your code using \"objects\".\n",
        "- oops consist of:\n",
        "1. Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "- These are the building blocks of your program.\n",
        "- An object represents a real-world entity (like a car, a person, a bank account)\n",
        "- Each object has:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Attributes: These are pieces of data that describe the object (e.g., the color of a car, the name of a person, the balance of a bank account).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Methods: These are the actions or operations that the object can perform (e.g., a car can start, a person can speak, a bank account can deposit).\n",
        "2.Classes:\n",
        "-A class is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects.\n",
        "Think of a class as a Car â€“ it defines the shape and features of many different, but you can observe many individual cars(objects) using it.\n",
        "- Why use OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Organization: It provides a structured way to organize code into manageable units.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reusability: Classes and objects can be reused in different parts of your application or in other projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maintainability: It makes code easier to maintain and modify because changes in one object are less likely to affect other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flexibility: It allows your code to be flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism: Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows you to treat objects of different classes in a unified way\n",
        "- Example Scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have an application that needs to process different types of media (audio, video, images).\n",
        "\n",
        "Without polymorphism, you might have different processing functions for each type (e.g., processAudio, processVideo, processImage).\n",
        "\n",
        "With polymorphism, you can create a base class Media and subclasses Audio, Video, Image, each with its own implementation for a process() method. Your main code just calls media.process() which will handle each type in its own appropriate way.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Attributes (Data): Variables that store the object's state or information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Methods (Behavior): Functions that define the object's actions and how it interacts with data.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "- Each object has its own unique set of attribute values, even if they share the same methods\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that work on that data together within an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This means that the object is responsible for managing its internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It also hides the object's internal details from the outside world, preventing accidental modification and keeping the code more organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Showing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You interact with an object through its public methods without needing to know the specifics of how the methods work internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For example, when you drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals (the abstract interface) without needing to understand the inner workings of the engine.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (also called magic methods or special methods) are methods with double underscores on each side of the name (e.g., __init__, __str__). These methods allow you to customize the behavior of Python objects and implement features such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Object creation (__init__, __new__)\n",
        "\n",
        "String representation (__str__, __repr__)\n",

        "\n",
        "Callable behavior (__call__)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- The ability to create new classes based on existing ones, reusing code and defining relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A new class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class (superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "- For instance, a \"Dog\" class could inherit from an \"Animal\" class and inherit common features and behavior. Then add new attributes and methods specific to the Dog class.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows you to treat objects of different classes in a unified way.\n",
        " -Example Scenario:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism makes OOP more powerful, flexible, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It allows you to write code that is more generic, reusable, and extensible, reducing code complexity and improving the overall structure of your programs\n",

        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "-  Python achieves encapsulation through:\n",

        "- Naming Conventions: Using underscores (single and double) to indicate the intended visibility and access levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Name Mangling: Using double underscores to make attributes and methods harder to access directly from outside the class, thus making them more private.\n",

        "- You can't have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a single class.\n",
        "-  Python does allow you to have one method that can handle different parameters via default parameters or variable arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overriding is a powerful mechanism in OOP that allows subclasses to customize the behavior of inherited methods.\n",
        "- Method overriding is when a subclass (child class) provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).\n",
        "- Imagine a parent class has a method called speak().\n",
        "- The parent class might have a generic implementation of speak().\n",
        "- Now, a child class (like a Dog class) can override the speak() method to provide its own specific implementation (like barking).\n",
        "-  When you call speak() on a Dog object, you'll hear a bark, not the generic sound from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "- This means you can use the syntax of accessing an attribute (e.g., obj.my_attribute) to call a method\n",

        "Key Features and Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Attribute-like Access:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can access a method as if it were a regular attribute, without using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Controlled Access (Encapsulation):\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can control how an attribute is accessed, modified, or deleted.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Read-Only Attributes:\n",

        "- The @property decorator defines the getter method (the method that is called when you access the attribute).\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can also define setter and deleter methods using @attribute.setter and @attribute.deleter decorators, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "- These methods are called when you assign a value to the attribute or delete the attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.@property Decorator:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The method decorated with @property becomes the getter method for the attribute.\n",

        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important because it promotes code flexibility and reusability.\n",
        "-  It lets you write more general code that can work with objects of different types, without knowing their specific class.\n",
        "- This makes code easier to maintain, extend, and test.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that:\n",

        "- The specific version of a method called will depend on the actual type of the object.\n",

        "\n",
        "-Method chaining is a technique where methods on an object return the object itself.\n",
        "- This allows you to call multiple methods sequentially, using a single statement.\n",

        "- When you define this method in your class, you can invoke the object by calling it as if it was a function.\n",
