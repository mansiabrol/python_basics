        "- The entire source code is translated into machine code (binary instructions) by a compiler before the program runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: C, C++, Java.\n",

        "- Execution is faster because the machine code is directly executed by the CPU.\n",

        "- Execution is slower compared to compiled languages, as the interpreter needs to translate each line during execution.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exception handling is a mechanism to deal with errors that occur during the execution of a program (runtime errors).\n",
        "\n",
        "- It allows you to gracefully handle these errors instead of crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "- The primary purpose of the finally block is to ensure that a specific block of code is always executed, regardless of what happens within the try block or any except blocks that might handle exceptions\n",
        "- It is primarily used for cleanup tasks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Closing files or network connections\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Releasing resources\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Ensuring that specific actions are always performed, no matter what happens in the try block\n",
        "- The finally block in exception handling is not about handling errors; it's about guaranteeing that certain critical actions (typically cleanup) are performed regardless of whether errors occurred or not.  \n",
        "- This makes your programs more robust and prevents resources from being lost or corrupted, ensures your program is stable after failures and helps keep the program in a consistent state.\n",

        "- The __del__ method (destructor) is called when an object is about to be garbage collected (removed from memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "- It allows for final actions to be performed before the object is destroyed, like releasing external resources associated with the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- However, rely on the garbage collection; you do not have much control on when the __del__ method is called. It is best practice to use 'with' statements to clean up resources like files.\n",
